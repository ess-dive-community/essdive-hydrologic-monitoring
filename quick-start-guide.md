## Quickstart Guide for Hydrologic Monitoring Data and Metadata ESS-DIVE Reporting Format  
  
1 - **Open the three templates (Data, Sensor, Terminology).** If you have more than one data file or more than one sensor, you have a few options for the total number of files. See the readme for details and a graphic depicting the options.
  
2 - **Open the Recommended Vocabulary File** for suggested column headers for your Data File. If you choose to use your own, the only allowed special characters are underscores and hyphens. No spaces are allowed.
  
3 - **Populate all required fields** (shaded) in the templates and **populate optional fields as desired**. Note that two fields in the Sensor File have controlled vocabularies.
