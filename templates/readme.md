## ESS-DIVE Hydrologic Monitoring Reporting Format Templates

The **data file template, sensor method template, and location method templates** should be downloaded and populated for use with this reporting format. Each template has two file formats provided for use. For each, there is .xlsx file with three tabs: (1) template with all fields and instructions; (2) template with only required fields and no instructions; (3) template with all fields and no instructions. Choose one tab in each template to populate. When it is complete, save the tab as .csv. Each template also has a .csv version of the all fields/no instructions tab that can be used instead of the .xlsx file.

The **file-level metadata (FLMD) template and data dictionary templates** are provided to comply with the ESS-DIVE FLMD and CSV Reporting Formats and are pre-populated for the user. They should be downloaded, updated with the appropriate user information, and saved as csvs.
