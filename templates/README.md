## ESS-DIVE Hydrologic Monitoring Reporting Format Templates

The **data file template, installation method template, file-level metadata (FLMD), and data dictionary (dd) templates** should be downloaded and populated for use with this reporting format. Each template has two file formats provided for use: (1) MS Excel (.xlsx) with instructions, examples, required fields, and optional fields; and (2) comma-separated (.csv) with column headers and no guidance content. If you choose to use the MS Excel versions (recommended), the final file you save for your data package must be a .csv file. 

The **FLMD and dd templates** are provided to comply with the ESS-DIVE FLMD Reporting Format and are partially pre-populated for the user. They should be downloaded, updated with the appropriate user information, and saved as.csv files.
