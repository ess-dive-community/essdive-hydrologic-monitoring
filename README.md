# Getting started with the ESS-DIVE Hydrological Monitoring Reporting Format

## About the Hydrological Monitoring Reporting Format
SCOPE - This reporting format is intended for water level, temperature, electrical conductivity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH measured in situ using sensors deployed in water bodies.

SUMMARY - This standard uses a **three file system to organize data, sensor metadata, and terminology metadata.** The reporting format is designed to be flexible for each userâ€™s needs. If the user has measured parameters outside the scope or has other columns they would like to add, they should do so. Aside from required fields, the user should only populate their file with the fields relevant to their data. 

## Quickstart Guide for Hydrologic Monitoring Data and Metadata ESS-DIVE Reporting Format  
1 - **Read the Instructions file** and **Term Guide file**  

2 - **Open the three templates (Data, Sensor, Terminology).** If you have more than one data file or more than one sensor, you have a few options for the total number of files. See the instructions file for details and a graphic depicting the options.
  
3 - **Open the Recommended Vocabulary File** for suggested column headers for your Data File. If you choose to use your own, the only allowed special characters are underscores and hyphens. No spaces are allowed.
  
4 - **Populate all required fields** in the templates and **populate optional fields as desired**. Note that two fields in the Sensor File and the Terminology File have controlled vocabularies. Exclude the optional columns you do not populate. No empty cells are permitted. **Find the full list of fields to populate in the Term Guide file**
