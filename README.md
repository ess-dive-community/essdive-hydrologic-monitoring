## About the Hydrological Monitoring Reporting Format
SCOPE - This reporting format is intended for water level, temperature, electrical conductivity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH measured in situ using sensors deployed in water bodies.

SUMMARY - This standard uses a **three file system to organize data, location metadata, and sensor metadata.** The reporting format is designed to be flexible for each userâ€™s needs. If the user has measured parameters outside the scope or has other columns they would like to add, they should do so. Aside from required fields, the user should only populate their file with the fields relevant to their data. 

## Quickstart Guide for Hydrologic Monitoring Data and Metadata ESS-DIVE Reporting Format  
1 - **Read the Instructions file** and **Term Guide file**  

2 - **Download the three templates (Data, Location Metadata, Sensor Metadata).** If you have more than one data file or more than one sensor, you have a few options for the total number of files. See the instructions file for details and a graphic depicting the options.
  
3 - **Download the Recommended Vocabulary File** for suggested column headers for your Data File. If you choose to use your own, the only allowed special characters are underscores and hyphens. No spaces are allowed.
  
4 - **Populate all required fields** in the templates and **populate optional fields as desired**. Note that two fields in the Location Metadata have controlled vocabularies. Exclude the optional columns you do not populate. No empty cells are permitted. **Find the full list of fields to populate in the Term Guide file**


## A Quick Look at the Templates
Screengrabs of templates filled in with example information are below and in the graphics folder. Each template is shown first with only required fields and then again with both required and optional fields. The csv version of the templates are included in the file list for use.
